# An Algorithm That Combines Genetic and Image Features for Outcome Prediction

Summary: This study proposes a multimodal fusion machine learning model that integrates histopathological images and gene expression data. To address the high dimensionality of the genomic modality, we designed a feature extraction strategy that incorporates pathway layers and self-normalizing neural networks. For image data, convolutional neural networks were employed. Features from both modalities were fused using tensor product fusion and optimized using the Cox loss function, with the concordance index used as the evaluation metric.
